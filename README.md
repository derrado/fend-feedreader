# Udacity FEND-Project: Feedreader

Changes were solely made in  /jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

## How to run
You can clone the repository and run the index.html file or you can just [click this link](https://derrado.github.io/fend-feedreader/)

## Important
By default, testing an async-operation fails if not completed during 5 seconds.
If the testings fails due to a unexpected longer-runnning fetch of feeds, just reload and run the tests again.
